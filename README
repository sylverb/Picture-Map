About Picture-Map :
Picture Map was my first application, I recently decided to rewrite it and to publish it on the AppStore.
Basically I rewrote everything from scratch by using different code found here and there ... It took me only few hours of work and it is a sample of what could be done without a lot of work ...

Code used in Picture-Map :
- The application is based on MapPointClustering done by vladzz : https://github.com/vladzz/MapPointClusteringPrototypeIphone
- It is using three20 modified by me to show pictures from the photo libraries (ALAsset) : https://github.com/sylverb/three20
- It is based on various source code samples found on stackoverflow.com (mainly to deal with ALAsset)

Have fun,
Sylver
